Each peer in the network can manage its own projects (a set of files) using a simplified version of the Git protocol. The system allows users to create a new repository in a specific folder, add new files to be tracked, apply changes to the local repository (commit function), push changes to the network, and pull changes from the network. The Git protocol follows a specific behavior to handle conflicts, which are then resolved manually.",
